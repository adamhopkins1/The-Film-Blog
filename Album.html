                                this November on Apple TV plus is from the Director of the 2018 film
                                "Green Book" Which went on to previously win the Audience Award at the
                                2017 Toronto Film Festival in the film which switches settings from a
                                civil-rights era south to a Vietnam-war setting with an absurd premise
                                is lead by Zac Efron and Russel Crowe Zac plays an aimless purposeless
                                character who gets inspired to deliver Beer to his friends who are
                                fighting in the Vietnam War. The feature has potential to play to the
                                Toronto Film Crowd and to the male voting block of attendees who are
                                Academy Members Could this and Causeway starring Jennifer Lawrence be
                                Apple big players this fall? Lets not forget this could be a year of
                                excellent films such as Babylon(more on that later) and Other strong
                                players set to release within the timeframe.And lest we forget Apple's
                                last best picture winner was last years CODA which got its premier at
                                last years Sundance Film Festival.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Finally the biggest picuture possibly of the TIFF will
                                be Babylon which the Tiff audiences will recieve early first look
                                footage of alongside a Q&A session with Director Damien Chazelle. This
                                will be pivotal not only for the filmaker and the season overall but for
                                the distributor Paramount Pictures who is currently in Freefall
                                financially and creatively. If Babylon does the impossible and saves
                                Paramount Pictures from Chapter 11 this will be a moumental moment in
                                the studios history but alongside it Babylon may have the Cineaste
                                effect the same way Top Gun:Maverick had on the Blockbuster film
                                audience. Babylon is an upcoming film written directed produced by
                                Damien Chazelle whose last film "La La Land" earned him a Best Director
                                Oscar and his co-star Emma Stone her first Best Actress Oscar. This is a
                                huge film that is said to be over 3hrs in length and has been compared
                                to Fellini's Satyricon and F.Scott Fitzgerald's The American Dream on
                                steroids.It stars Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie as actors transitioning
                                from the silent era of film of the 20's to the Talkies of the 30's it
                                features a huge ensemble cast that will make it easily a Sag
                                Frontrunner. So this is the major film not only for the TIFF crowd but
                                for everyone in the orbit of Cinema, Film and Movies overall. </p>
